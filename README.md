# MRI
This chapter uses preprocessed T1-weighted MRI to classify age group and gender. It compares interpretable classical features (ROI/atlas means, morphometrics, PCA) with 3D CNNs (ResNet3D/MC3), using strict subject-wise splits to avoid leakage. Results are analyzed with confusion matrices, t-SNE, and Grad-CAM.
